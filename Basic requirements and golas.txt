This project aims to develop a programmable old-school calculator using Arduino, blending retro aesthetics with modern functionality. 
The calculator will support basic arithmetic operations and programmable capabilities to execute custom user-defined calculations. 
Requirements include a user-friendly interface with physical buttons, a small display, and the ability to store and recall programs.
 It will be powered by an Arduino microcontroller, ensuring easy programming and flexibility. The design will prioritize compactness and battery efficiency, making it portable and durable. 
The final product should appeal to both electronics hobbyists and those interested in learning programming through tangible, interactive hardware.
